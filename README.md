# TODO List Part 1: Frontend Basics
Build a TODO list React App.

To get started, create a react app with `create-react-app`, give it a fun name. This app will consist of a list of iteams that can be:

  - Added to
  - Removed From
  - Items Edited
  - Items "checked" off

Style it as you please, you are welcome to also leverage react component libraries such as material-ui, bootstrap, semantic, etc.

Make the TODO list component consist of:

  - a list of items
  - the ability to add items
  - the ability to order the items
 
 Each item having:

  - a checkbox
  - the text of the item
  - a way to edit the item
  - a way delete the item
 
 Feel free to add any additional features that you would like.

The data structure of the item should include:

String: the text of the item
Boolean: the state of the item (checked or not)
Number: order of the item in the list

Feel free to add any additional fields to the item object. Hold the data in the app's state using your preferred method.


**Considerations:**
  - Edge cases
  - Empty states
  - Different browsers
  - Responsiveness (mobile vs web)


When you are done, submit the assignment and we will do a code review process where changes will be requested and you'll need to adress the feedback.
