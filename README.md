## Instructions

To get started, create a react app with `create-react-app`, give it a fun name. This app will consist of a list of iteams that can be:

  - Added to
  - Removed From
  - Items Edited
  - Items "checked" off

Style it as you please, you are welcome to also leverage react component libraries such as material-ui, bootstrap, semantic, etc but bonus points if you build your own components from scratch!

Make the TODO list component consist of:

  - a list of items
  - the ability to add items
  - the ability to order the items
 
 Each item having:

  - a checkbox
  - the text of the item
  - a way to edit the item
  - a way delete the item
 
Feel free to add any additional features that you would like, but be sure to cover all features described here.

The data structure of the item should include:

String: the text of the item
Boolean: the state of the item (checked or not)
Number: order of the item in the list

Feel free to add any additional fields to the item object. Hold the data in the app's state using your preferred method.


**Considerations:**
  - Edge cases
  - Empty states
  - Different browsers
  - Responsiveness (mobile vs web)
  - Project organization
  - Code style


When you are done, submit the assignment and we will do a code review process where changes will be requested and you'll need to adress the feedback. Be sure to include a readme with instructions for running the app.
